A library for reading/writing/playing music modules (MOD/IT/S3M/XM/etc.)

               ============================================

**WARNING**
This is still a major work in progress! Even though these files are coded to be
opened read-only, I am not responsible for any module files loaded with this
library that become damaged! **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

Here's a breakdown of current functionality:
(r = Read, w = Write, x = Execute/Playback)

Formats        Functions          Comments
-------        ---------          --------
  IT               r              Reading raw sample data still not implemented
  S3M              r              Reading raw sample data still not implemented
